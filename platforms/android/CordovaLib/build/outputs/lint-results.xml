        id="Assert"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Assertions are unreliable. Use `BuildConfig.DEBUG` conditional checks instead."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Assertions"
        explanation="Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik (`adb shell setprop debug.assert 1`), but the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform conditional checking inside `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { }` blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.

For example, you can replace `assert speed > 0` with `if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed > 0)) { throw new AssertionError() }`.

(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)"

        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API field references in the application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and Strings, which were introduced in later versions.

It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and device whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs tbe guarded.

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.
